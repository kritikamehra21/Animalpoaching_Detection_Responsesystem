# Animalpoaching_Detection_Responsesystem
Intelligent Poaching Detection and Response System An AI-powered system designed to detect poaching activities using computer vision and automatically alert authorities through email notifications. The project leverages deep learning, real-time object detection, and a modern web interface to assist wildlife conservation efforts.
Project Overview
Wildlife poaching is a major threat to biodiversity across the globe. This project aims to provide a technology-driven solution by detecting suspicious activities such as the presence of poachers, weapons, or animals using images and videos. Upon detection, the system sends automated alerts with visual evidence to administrators.
